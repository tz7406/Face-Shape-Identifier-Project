# Face Shape Identifier
PROJECT TITLE: Face Shape identifier (Square/Round/Oval/Oblong/Heart)

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This network was trained with 2500 images of 
female celebrity faces categorized into 5 different face shape groups.
The different face shape groups are as follows: square, round, oval,
oblong, and heart. The trained network can take input (e.g. an image 
ofyour face taken by a webcam) and analyze your face shape to see 
which category of face shape you fall in. The model network used for 
this project was ResNet18 for image recognition and classification 
into several categories.
